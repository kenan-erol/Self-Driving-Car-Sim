In China the specific vehicle needs to get a license same with autonomous driving?

We want to get the corner/edge cases for safer driving

THERE IS A NEED FOR BETTER SIMULATION PLATFORMS AS CURRENT ONES ONLY USE LOW-LEVEL APIS

Camera and sensor outputs

Inputs:

Multidoule autonomous driving system (ADS)
- LIDAR
- Camera
- IMU
Calculate a vector that shows how similar the driving situation the car is currently in is to a previous dirivng condition

Baidu Apollo 5.0
Using NLP to understand traffic rules

Waymo uses multi sensor fusion
MSF robustness

zero sum learning for new road signs like "right turn from left only"
